## My process

I started with writing the HTML codes for each part of the webpage, I have 5 parts (Header, Section, Section, Article, and Footer). I write the HTML codes for each part and also write the CSS code for that part before moving onto the next part. I did all these on desktop-first responsive design. After building the desktop screen, I built the Tablet screen (max-width: 1030px), after that, I built the mobile screen (max-width: 750px).

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first responsive design


### What I learned

In this challenge, I learnt how to use a color overlay on a background image, this is the first time I'm using it in a project. 
And I also practise my media query skills in this challenge beacause it's something I'm not yet perfect in it.

```html
<footer>
  .....

 </footer>
```
```css
footer {
  background: linear-gradient(0deg, rgba(70, 150, 168, 0.8), rgba(70, 150, 168, 0.8)), url(./Images/image-footer.jpg);
}
```

### Continued development

I want to focus on media query and responive design. Also currntly learning JavaScript (tho' I didn'nt use it in this challenge), I'd like to 
focus on learning JavaScript and I'd like to continue with ReactJs after before moving to Backend.
